# Changelog

All notable changes to the Schema Generator project.

## [2.8.1] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

#### Service Provider Address Requirement
- **Fixed "Missing field address" error** for Service.provider (HVACBusiness)
- AI prompt now explicitly requires complete address in Service.provider
- Added post-processing safety net that ensures provider always has address
- Fixed standalone HVACBusiness also getting complete address (not just Service.provider)
- Now handles both missing AND incomplete addresses
- Validation now treats missing provider.address as ERROR (not warning)
- Google Rich Results Test will no longer fail for missing provider address

#### Schema Replacement on Publish
- **Fixed duplicate schemas issue** - Old schemas are now deleted before inserting new ones
- Previously, publishing new schemas would ADD to existing ones instead of replacing
- This caused Google to see both old (broken) and new schemas on the same page
- All insert endpoints now delete existing schemas first by default (`replaceExisting: true`)

#### FAQ Extraction Fix
- **Fixed Elementor nested accordion FAQ extraction** - answers without `<p>` tags now extracted
- Previously only found answers inside `<p>` tags, missing text directly in `.e-con` container
- Now properly extracts all 5 FAQs from pages like `/ac-service-hamilton/`

---

## [2.8.0] - 2026-02-02

### Added

#### AI-Powered Schema Generation with Auto-Verification
- **Complete workflow**: Crawl → Analyze → Generate → Verify → Review → Publish
- AI generates ALL appropriate schemas based on page type (Service, FAQPage, HVACBusiness, BreadcrumbList, WebPage)
- **Auto-verification** runs immediately after generation
- FAQs extracted from page content only (never invented by AI)

#### AI Verification (Data Consistency + Google Compliance)
- **Data accuracy checks**:
  - Business name matches page content
  - Address/location is correct
  - Phone number verified against page
  - Service areas actually mentioned on page
  - FAQs match page content (not fabricated)
- **Google Rich Results compliance** check
- **Coherence check**: Schema data is internally consistent
- Returns `canPublish: true/false` status

### Fixed
- **Gemini models**: Updated to `gemini-2.0-flash` (1.5 models deprecated)
- **Elementor FAQ extraction**: Added support for nested accordion (`details.e-n-accordion-item`)
- **Regex bug**: Fixed `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'split')` on location pages
- **Canadian addresses**: Default country now "CA", properly detects ON/BC/AB provinces

### Changed
- Default AI provider changed to Gemini
- AI schema generator now produces all appropriate schema types for each page type
- Verification integrated into generation flow (not separate step)
